# Visitor Design Pattern Example

## Overview

The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add further operations to objects without having to modify them. It involves defining a new operation for each class of element, which means that the operation's logic is separated from the object structure. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to perform unrelated operations across a set of objects without contaminating the objects' code with these operations.

The Visitor pattern provides a way to separate an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates, promoting the Open/Closed Principle by allowing the addition of new operations without modifying the existing object structure.

Real-world applications of the Visitor pattern include:

- **Compilers**: Used in abstract syntax trees where operations like type-checking, optimization, and code generation are applied.
- **Document Processing**: Used to apply different formatting operations to various elements within a document (e.g., paragraphs, tables, images).
- **Graphics Systems**: To perform operations like rendering or hit-testing on a variety of graphical objects.

## Design

This project defines a simple scenario where a `School` object structure contains a list of `Kid` elements. Each `Kid` accepts visitors that can perform operations on them, such as a `Doctor` conducting a health checkup or a `Salesman` giving out school bags. The Visitor pattern is used to decouple the operations (health checkup, distribution of bags) from the `Kid` elements, allowing new operations to be added easily without changing the `Kid` class.

### Components

- **Visitor Interface (`IVisitor`)**: Declares a `Visit` method for the `Kid` element.
- **Concrete Visitors (`Doctor`, `Salesman`)**: Implement the `Visit` method to perform specific operations on the `Kid` elements.
- **Element Interface (`IElement`)**: Declares an `Accept` method that takes a visitor object.
- **Concrete Element (`Kid`)**: Implements the `Accept` method to accept a visitor and call its `Visit` method.
- **Object Structure (`School`)**: Maintains a list of `Kid` elements and provides a method to allow a visitor to perform operations on each `Kid`.
